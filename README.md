# Bread Manager

This is a mix of playing around with technologies but also trying to fix an actual problem I am having.

## current version

Currently I'm trying to redo the whole thing as a command line application since I realized that the whole thing is more complex then I thought and I was spending too much time working on the frontend instead of adding new features and generall completing the app.

## older versions

There are two other branches for the two other times I have tried to make this application work.
- cpp-bk
- tauri-bk

As the names suggest they are a C++ and Rust-Tauri version respecively.


### cpp
The cpp version ties into a local mongodb instance to store the data and manipulate it.
(made with the help of @henrybley)

### rust - tauri
This on on the other hand stores the files as binaries in the Application directory and works, as the name suggests with the Tauri framework for rust. As the frontend framework Leptos is used to keep everything in the rust ecosystem.
